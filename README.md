# Seat Assignment

This script takes class rosters and assigns a random seat to each
student.

The rosters should be formatted as a CSV where each column
has the class name (period, subject, etc.) followed by a row for each
student.

The output will follow the same format except the order of students
in each class will be randomly shuffled.
